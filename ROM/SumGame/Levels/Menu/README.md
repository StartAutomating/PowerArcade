This directory contains the game menu.

This directory can often be copy/pasted into any game that needs a menu, with only minor modifications.

[Menu.ps1](Menu.ps1) initalizes the menu, and it displays messages from a few properties of the $Game object:

* Logo
* Instructions
* Controls

Additionally, [OnKey_Space.ps1](OnKey_Space.ps1) switches to the main game level to start playing.
